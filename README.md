**WordSprint is a dual-purpose application designed for word lovers, writers, and students.** It combines a fast-paced, brain-teasing word game with a sophisticated, AI-powered "Editor's Report" to analyze any text you provide.

Whether you want to test your lexical limits under pressure or get a professional-grade breakdown of your writing, WordSprint has you covered.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The WordSprint Game
*   **Dynamic & Fast-Paced Gameplay:** Race against the clock to form as many words as you can from a jumble of letters. It's an exhilarating test of your vocabulary and mental agility.
*   **Intelligent Word Puzzles:** The game's puzzles are generated by an advanced AI (`llama3-8b-8192` via Groq), ensuring a unique and challenging experience every single time.
*   **Offline First:** The core word game runs entirely on your device, allowing you to play anytime, anywhere, without needing an internet connection.

### 2. The AI Editor's Report
*   **Comprehensive Text Analysis:** Go beyond the game with our linguistic analysis feature. Write or paste any text to get an instant report on:
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Understand the emotional leaning of your text with a score and label (Positive, Negative, etc.).
    *   **Tone Detection:** Identify primary tones like *Formal, Optimistic, or Confident* to see how your writing comes across.
    *   **Grammatical Corrections:** Get detailed suggestions for spelling, punctuation, and phrasing to improve your work.
    *   **Key Entity Recognition:** Automatically identify and list the important people, places, and concepts in your text.
